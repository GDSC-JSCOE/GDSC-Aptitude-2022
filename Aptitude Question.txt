After putting aside 10% for taxi I was left with 90% of the money, with which I can buy 135 pencils (90% of 150) or 45(90% of 50) pens,
I bought 54 pencils and P pens, or I could have bought (54 + 3P) pencil,

       3/4x = 0.9 C.P, C.P = 3x / 3.6
       If S.P = x, Profit %  = (x- 3x/3.6 ) / ( 3x/3.6 ) * 100 = 60/3 = 20%

A. 95/2 degrees
B. 90/3 degrees
C. 94/3 degrees
D. 95/3 degrees

Ans:(A)
Explanation: As, the hour hand covers 360 degrees in 12 hrs.
In the clock the time is 3.25 = 3 hrs 25 min = 41/12 hrs.
So, the angle traced by hour hand = (360/12 x 41/12) degrees = 205 degrees.
The minute hand covers 360 degrees in 60 minutes.
So, the angle is traced by minute hand in 25 min = (360/60 x 25) degrees = 150 degrees.
Hence, the required angle of the clock = (150- 205/2) degrees = 95/2 degrees.
